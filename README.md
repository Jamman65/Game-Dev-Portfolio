# Expense Tracker (ASP.NET C#)
Welcome to my expense tracker where I have developed an application using ASP.NET, C#, HTML, CSS and SQL which allows users to:


* Create individual categories

* Create new transactions
  
* Add transactions to an interactive table
  
* Edit or delete any categories/transactions that have been created
  
* View all Income and expenses via interactive charts
  
* The application automatically calculates all the incomes and expenses based on the user's input
  
* All of the data is stored within an SQL Database even when the application is closed
